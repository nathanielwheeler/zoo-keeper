# Welcome to your zoo, where you're the zoo keeper!
### Part of being the zoo keeper is knowing all of the animals in your zoo. You will, first, create a new class for each animal in your zoo, then, second, create an at least one instance of each animal, and, finally, create collections of like animals.

#### Objective:
Students will use javascript in order to create classes and instances of those classes. Students will also practice with array methods.

### Part 1: Creating Classes
Create a new class for each animal in your zoo.  Create an animal class for every letter of the alphabet. Don't forget to declare your classes in their own unique files.
```js
class Alligator {
    constructor(
        name = '',
        color = '',
        gender = '',
        weight = 0,
        tailLengthInch = 0,
        teethSize = '',
    ) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.tailLengthInch = tailLengthInch;
        this.teethSize = teethSize;
    }
    eat(food) {
        console.log(`Chomp chomp all the ${food}ies.`)
    }
    speak(noise) {
        alert(`The ${this.constructor.name} says ${noise}!`)
    }
}

export default Alligator;
```
*Note: You need not have every property or member in this class in your classes, and likewise, you may include additional properties not shown above.*

### Part 2: Creating Instances
Create at least one instance of every animal class
```js
let ally = new Alligator("Ally", "Green", "F", 200, 60, "big");
```

### Part 3: Creating Collections of Like Animals
Group like animals in collections. Utilize array methods, e.g., *.push()* 

*Hint: how could you utilize a new class, Pen, or Cage, to accomplish Part 3?*
